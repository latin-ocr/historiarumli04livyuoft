AN ΕΡΙΤΟΜΕ of the three volumes of N IEBUHR’S HIS-
TORY ‘of ROME, with Chronological Tables and an Appendix.

By TRAVERS wass, B. C. L. F ellow and Tutor of University
College, Oxford, 8vo. in 1 vol. l5s.

“ This is a truly valuable work; Mr. Twiss has escaped the affectation
of mysticism‚ obscurity‚ and vulgarity, with which Niebuhr seems to
have infected most of his followers and translators. In the Appendix
there are some original investigations‚ which display great learning and
acuteness: we were particularly pleased with that on the office of dic-
tator.''—Atlienaeum.
